# AWS Load Balancer Controller Configuration (values.yaml override)
# Used when installing via Helm in an Amazon EKS environment
# ==================================================================

clusterName: ${cluster_name}  # Inject the name of your EKS cluster here
                              # The controller needs this to register with the Kubernetes API
                              # and interact with AWS resources (like ALBs/NLBs) correctly

serviceAccount:
  name: aws-load-balancer-controller
  # Name of the Kubernetes service account that the controller will use
  # This must match the service account name referenced in the Deployment
  # The service account must exist in the correct namespace (typically `kube-system`)

  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: ${role_arn}
    # This annotation enables IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
    # It binds the service account to a specific IAM role with permissions to:
    # - Manage Elastic Load Balancers (ALBs/NLBs)
    # - Modify Target Groups, Listeners, Security Groups, etc.
    # The `${role_arn}` should be a valid IAM role ARN that has the AWS Load Balancer Controller policy attached
